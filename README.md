Purpose:
To clean, analyze, and validate our claims regarding the Titanic dataset. 

Thesis: 
Women will have a higher survival rate than men. Youth will have a higher survival rate than adults.
Rich individuals will have a higher survival rate than poor. 

Conclusion:
Women had significantly greater survival rates. Based on ticket class and fare cost, 
wealth correlated with greater survival as well. Adult ages (20 - 40) showed significantly
worse survival rates than younger and older ages. Number of parents and children showed an
inconclusive relation to survival rate. Number of siblings/spouses did show a trend (greatest
survival at 1 with linear decrease to 4). The Titles graph further emphasized trends we have 
established as we see Mrs, Miss, and Master (referring to adult women, girls, and boys) having
exceptional survival rates, while Mr (adult men) having drastically lower survival rates. Rare
titles surprising did not signficantly correlate with a great survival rate as it neared 35% survival.
Finally, those embarking from the port of Cherbourg(C) had a significantly greater survival rate
than those embarking from the port of Queenstown(Q) and Southhampton(S). Thus, alongside other
findings, our thesis is correct.
